###Working day durutation: approx 10:30.

Learnt the basics of NodeJs and that Expressjs framework is a must use, NodeJs allows only server-side Java Scripting, for data-base MongoDB is probably the best choice due to it's json like style & still having a doubt to use or not to use AngularJs or go straight with pure Java Script.
